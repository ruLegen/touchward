# Single source of truth for the app's identity.
#
# Everything downstream — the bundle name, the executable, Info.plist, the code signature,
# the installed copy and the disk image — is derived from these four values, so renaming
# the app is one edit here rather than a hunt through scripts and plists.
#
# Changing APP_NAME or BUNDLE_ID makes macOS treat this as a different app: TCC grants for
# the old identity do not carry over and Accessibility / Input Monitoring must be granted
# again. Change them deliberately, not casually.

# Stable signing identity. TCC remembers Accessibility against the app's designated
# requirement; with an ad-hoc signature that includes the binary hash, so every rebuild
# looked like a brand new app and the grant was lost. A certificate keeps it constant.
# Create it once with scripts/make-signing-cert.sh. Empty falls back to ad-hoc.
